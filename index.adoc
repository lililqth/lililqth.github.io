I am a research assistant professor at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

*Research Interests:*

I am broadly interested in operating system, distributed systems, networking,
and security. Recently, I have been focusing on the operating system support for
heterogeneous multi-processor architecture.

*Previously:*

I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science at The
University of Hong Kong (my supervisor is https://i.cs.hku.hk/~heming/[Prof.
Heming Cui]), where I created secure and high-performance distributed systems
such as the in-datacenter permissioned blockchain. I received my Master degree
in School of Software at Tsinghua University, where I worked with
https://www.imem.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1335/2194.htm[Prof. Kueiming Lo] on formal
modeling and analysis of network protocols. Before that I received my Bachelor
degree in School of Software at Beijing Institute of Technology.
